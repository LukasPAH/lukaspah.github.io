<h2>About Custom Global Resources on Xbox One</h2>

<p>This page is about adding custom global resources to the Xbox One.
Why? To use custom textures on Realms, Multiplayer Games, or Servers without requesting the host apply the pack to the world.
The following method works due to the way Minecraft handles packs from the Marketplace with the same UUID and version number in manifest.json.
Additionally, I added the line</p>

"pack_scope": "global"

<p>to manifest.json to provide additional functionality. </p>
<br>
<p>To some, the method going to be presented may seem kind of "hacky".
This claim has some validation, as at any time, this method may be patched by either Mojang or Microsoft itself.
This method was discovered by me, LukasPlaysGames, in late August 2019.
Be careful and read the instructions CAREFULLY.</p>
<br>

<h2>Download Pack Manifests</h2>

<p>Currently available pack manifests are available for download at the following link.
If you are unsure which folder to click, choose the Texture Update Beta folder and follow the instructions below.</p>

<h2>Written Intructions</h2>
<p>***IMPORTANT: These instructions were written for downloading the Texture Update Beta.
The process will be the same if you want to use another pack from the store as a base instead.
Just download the correct pack from the Marketplace corresponding to the pack manifest you downloaded.***</p>
<br>
<p>

<p>Step 1</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the Texture Update Beta from the Marketplace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and place the sample manifest into any resource pack of choice.
  Manifest downloads are located in the "Download Pack Manifests" section on this page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the resource pack into the resource_packs folder using the UFO.Transfer method.

</ul>

<p>Step 4</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launch Minecraft. Go to global resources. 
  Delete the Texture Update Beta by applying the pack, clicking the green checkmark, then the trash icon. 
  This will delete the beta textures downloaded from the store, but not the custom ones. 
  You should be able to apply your textures using the Texture Update Beta icon in the global resource tab. 
  Therefore, use the texture update icon to activate the custom resources.</li>
</ul>

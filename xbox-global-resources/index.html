<h2>About Custom Global Resources on Xbox One</h2>

<p>This page is about adding custom global resources to the Xbox One ON VERSION 1.13 AND UP.
Why? To use custom textures on Realms, Multiplayer Games, or Servers without requesting the host apply the pack to the world.
The following method works due to the way Minecraft handles packs from the Marketplace with the same UUID and version number in manifest.json.
Additionally, I added the line</p>

"pack_scope": "global"

<p>to manifest.json to provide additional functionality. </p>
<br>
<p>To some, the method going to be presented may seem kind of "hacky".
This claim has some validation, as at any time, this method may be patched by either Mojang or Microsoft itself.
This method was discovered by me, LukasPlaysGames, in late August 2019. The method was revised in late November to provide functionality in newer versions of Minecraft.
Be careful and read the instructions CAREFULLY.</p>
<br>

<h2>Download Pack Manifests</h2>

<p>Currently available pack manifests are available for download at the following link.
If you are unsure which folder to click, choose the Texture Update Beta folder and follow the instructions below.</p>

<h2>Written Intructions</h2>
<p>***IMPORTANT: These instructions were written for downloading the Texture Update Beta.
The process will be the same if you want to use another pack from the store as a base instead.
Just download the correct pack from the Marketplace corresponding to the pack manifest you downloaded.***</p>
<br>
<p>

<p>Step 1</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the Texture Update Beta from the Marketplace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delete the Texture Update Beta from the Global Resources screen. You can do this by applying the pack, clicking the green checkmark, and then clicking the delete button. Once deleted, completely close Minecraft.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and the sample manifest and desired resource pack. Unzip the resource pack and place the sample manifest into the resource pack of choice. You will need to overwrite the manifest present in in the desired resource pack with the sample you downloaded from Mediafire.
  Manifest downloads are located in the "Download Pack Manifests" section on this page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the resource pack into the resource_packs folder using the My Files Explorer method.

</ul>

<p>Step 5</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launch Minecraft. Apply the Texture Update Beta Pack. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE PACK FROM THE MARKETPLACE. You should see that the custom pack should load. This indicates you have done the tutorial properly.</li>
</ul>

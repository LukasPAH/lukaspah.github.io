<h2>About Custom Global Resources on Xbox One</h2>

<p>This page is about adding custom global resources to the Xbox One ON VERSION 1.13 AND UP.
Why? To use custom textures on Realms, Multiplayer Games, or Servers without requesting the host apply the pack to the world.
The following method works due to the way Minecraft handles packs from the Marketplace with the same UUID and version number in manifest.json.
Additionally, I added the line</p>

"pack_scope": "global"

<p>to manifest.json to provide additional functionality. </p>
<br>
<p>To some, the method going to be presented may seem kind of "hacky".
This claim has some validation, as at any time, this method may be patched by either Mojang or Microsoft itself.
This method was discovered by me, LukasPlaysGames, in late August 2019. The method was revised in late November to provide functionality in newer versions of Minecraft.
Be careful and read the instructions CAREFULLY.</p>
<br>

<h2>Download Pack Manifests</h2>

<p>Currently available pack manifests are available for download at the following link.
If you are unsure which folder to click, choose the Texture Update Beta folder and follow the instructions below.</p>

<h2>Written Intructions</h2>
<p>***IMPORTANT: These instructions were written for downloading the Texture Update Beta.

<h2>Past Resource Pack Work</h2>
<br>
<p>Past resource packs that I have worked on include Faithful 32x32 and Faithful 64x64.
Both projects are now depreciated by me. 
Faithful 32x32 is on the Minecraft store, so you should get it there. 
Faithful 64x64 is currently being maintained by @MaceCRN on Twitter.
Future updates will come from him.</p>
<br>
<h2>Currently Working On</h2>
<br>
<p>Not a whole lot. Messing around. 
Still waiting on textures to be updated on Default 32x32, then I will update.</p>
